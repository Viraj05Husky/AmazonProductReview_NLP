# AmazonProductReview_NLP

In this project, we are going to investigate the Amazon's food reviews dataset containing more than 500,000 reviews in the period of 10 years (1999-2012). 
Our main goals are to understand the review trend and analyze the text data by NLP method. 
Firstly, we are going do some data wrangling, cleaning, and analyze the features individually to get a sense of the data. 
Next, we are going to do some data pre-processing to get it ready for the models. 
Then, we are going to do sentiment analysis, build 2 machine learnings learning models to determine whether a review is positive, neutral or negative – Logistic (positive/negative), Naïve Bayes (neutral/positive/negative).
